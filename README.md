# A blackjack trainer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pastly/blackjack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pastly/blackjack)

This started as some CLI programs to help me train on basic strategy, but it
has morphed focus into a WASM project.

CLI binaries will be kept around for a while, but I do not currently
plan on maintaining them very much or necessarily fixing them if they break.
They probably are already partially broken.
